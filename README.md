# HUSTOJ Judge Core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BLumia/HUSTOJ-Core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BLumia/HUSTOJ-Core)

Fork and separate from original [HUST OJ GitHub repo](https://github.com/zhblue/hustoj/). 

Since HUST OJ repo still keeping SVN-like file structure, although we only want the source code of judge core, everytime we need to clone the full repo to get that part of code. So I create this repo to separate the judge core out. Will make it easier to modify, and integrating with Travis-CI.
